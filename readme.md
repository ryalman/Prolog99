## My Solutions to Prolog 99

Please refer to the original solutions at 
[Prolog Site](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/).  
The solutions here may not be optimal.

Please note that I did not number the solutions but I grouped them as the 
problems.

**Thanks to Werner Hett for maintaining such a great problem set.**
